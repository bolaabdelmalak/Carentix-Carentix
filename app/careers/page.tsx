const faqs = [
  { q: "Do I need prior healthcare experience?", a: "Not for the Academy track. We hire for aptitude, integrity, and a genuine drive to master the work — then we build the healthcare knowledge through a structured, production-integrated program. Experienced professionals are welcome too and may enter at a higher grade after assessment." },
  { q: "What exactly is the Carentix Academy?", a: "A 6–9 month immersive professional program — not onboarding. Across three phases you learn revenue cycle, prior auth, scribing, verification, compliance, and AI workflows while doing supervised real client work. You graduate with the Carentix Certified credential after passing a 120-question exam, a simulation battery, and a Graduation Board interview." },
  { q: "Is this a remote role?", a: "Yes — we’re remote. You work from anywhere on company-managed equipment behind a mandatory VPN with MFA, inside a structured operation with daily check-ins and coaching. It’s the support of an institution with the flexibility of remote work." },
  { q: "How does compensation actually work?", a: "Academy grades (G1–G3) are paid competitively during the development period. On graduation you transition immediately to the Certified Professional track — a genuine step-change in compensation, plus performance bonuses, profit sharing at G4+, and long-term incentives at G9+. Our philosophy is to invest in exceptional people and reward performance and mastery." },
  { q: "What happens if I don’t graduate?", a: "The standard is real and enforced — not everyone who enters graduates. Gates exist at every phase, and they’re not relaxed for candidates who are “almost there.” That’s exactly what makes the credential valuable. We coach hard to help you clear them, and we handle every outcome with dignity." },
  { q: "Do you really use AI in the day-to-day work?", a: "Yes, natively. AI tools are taught from day one and woven into every workflow — you’ll graduate fluent in them. But AI augments human judgment here; it never replaces it. Every clinical or billing output gets human review, and accountability always belongs to people." },
